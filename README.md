Inspired by zetbaitsu's [Compressor](https://github.com/zetbaitsu/Compressor), Resizer is a lightweight and easy-to-use Android library for image scaling. It allows you to resize an image file to a smaller or bigger one while keeping the aspect ratio.

#### Include Resizer into your project
1. Add the JitPack repository to your top-level build.gradle at the end of repositories
```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
2. Add the dependency in your module-level build.gradle
```groovy
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.iamdeveloper-lopez:Resizer:v1.6'
}
```

#### Pass in the original image file and get the resized image as a new file
```java
File resizedImage = new Resizer(this)
        .setTargetLength(1080)
        .setQuality(80)
        .setOutputFormat("JPEG")
        .setOutputFilename("resized_image")
        .setOutputDirPath(storagePath)
        .setSourceImage(originalImage)
        .getResizedFile();
```
#### Pass in the original image file and get the resized image as a new bitmap
```java
Bitmap resizedImage = new Resizer(this)
        .setTargetLength(1080)
        .setSourceImage(originalImage)
        .getResizedBitmap();
```
Note: You only need to specify the target length (in pixel) of the longer side (or either side if it's a square) of the image. Resizer will calculate the rest automatically.

#### Using RxJava 2 with RxAndroid to get the resized image asynchronously
```java
final File[] resizedImage = new File[1];
new Resizer(this)
        .setTargetLength(1080)
        .setQuality(80)
        .setOutputFormat("JPEG")
        .setOutputFilename("resized_image")
        .setOutputDirPath(storagePath)
        .setSourceImage(originalImage)
        .getResizedFileAsFlowable()
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
        .subscribe(new Consumer<File>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(File file) {
                resizedImage[0] = file;
            }
        }, new Consumer<Throwable>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(Throwable throwable) {
                throwable.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
```
```java
final Bitmap[] resizedImage = new Bitmap[1];
new Resizer(this)
        .setTargetLength(1080)
        .setSourceImage(originalImage)
        .getResizedBitmapAsFlowable()
        .subscribeOn(Schedulers.io())
        .observeOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())
        .subscribe(new Consumer<Bitmap>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(Bitmap bitmap) {
                resizedImage[0] = bitmap;
            }
        }, new Consumer<Throwable>() {
            @Override
            public void accept(Throwable throwable) {
                throwable.printStackTrace();
            }
        });
```
Note: You don't need to declare the new image as final nor array if it's an instance variable of the class, instead of a local variable in a function.

#### Library specification
    Minimum SDK: API 16
     
    Default settings:
    targetLength: 1080
    quality: 80
    outputFormat: JPEG
    outputFilename: same as the source file
    outputDirPath: the external files directory of your app
     
    Supported input formats:
    BMP
    GIF
    JPEG
    PNG
    WEBP
     
    Supported output formats:
    JPEG
    PNG
    WEBP
     
    Supported quality range: 0~100
    The higher value, the better image quality but larger file size
    PNG, which is a lossless format, will ignore the quality setting
